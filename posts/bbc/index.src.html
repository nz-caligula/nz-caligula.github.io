    <div align="center"> You know things are really bad in New Zealand when even the BBC is reporting on how bad things have become" <br> You can't make a living in New Zealand. There is no living. You just go backwards. You don't get a choice if you want live, you have to move, or New Zealand has to change. I want a future for my children and there is none in New Zealand,"<br>
