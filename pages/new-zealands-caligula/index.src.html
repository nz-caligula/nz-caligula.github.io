      <br>
      In Recent times there have been many comparisons between Jacinda
      Ardern's Labour Government and Stalin's Communism or Germany's
      Fascism.<br>
      <br>
      The better comparison is Jacinda Ardern with the Roman Emperor
      Caligula.<br>
      <br>
      Caligula was proclaimed emperor by the Senate on 18 March AD 37.
      When Caligula entered Rome on 28 March the exuberant crowd hailed
      him as "our baby" and "our star". Caligula was described as the
      first emperor who was admired by everyone in "all the world, from
      the rising to the setting sun."<br>
      <br>
      In the 2020 New Zealand General Election, Jacinda Ardern's Labour
      Party won an unprecedented landslide victory. Winning a remarkable
      50% of the party vote and a total of 65 out of 120 seats. Making
      Jacinda Ardern the first MMP era Prime Minister to be able to
      govern alone without the need of a supporting party. For many on
      the left it was seen as a new-era in politics, we were to have a
      government of kindness and integrity. Jacinda was showered with
      congratulations from media all around the world described in terms
      such as - "JACINDA Arden has earned respect worldwide for humanity
      and competence as an outstanding world leader. Her leadership is a
      great example of leadership of unity and peace. Other leaders of
      the world have a lot to learn if they want to make this world less
      divisive and more united for peace and harmony."<br>
      <br>
      Both Caligula and Jacinda ascended to government with great
      promises and hope.<br>
      <br>
      Caligula's first acts were said to be generous in spirit, helping
      those who had been harmed by the tax system, granting military
      bonuses, and abolishing the treason trials. Within a short period
      of time he became one of the most diabolical and heinous leaders
      that ever ruled in ancient Rome. Caligula had members of his only
      family executed and exiled, spread terrible rumours about other
      politicians, and had many of his opponents murdered. Caligula
      began appearing in public dressed as various gods and demigods
      such as Hercules, Mercury, Venus and Apollo, he even had the heads
      removed from various statues of gods located across Rome and
      replaced them with his own.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, Jacinda Ardern's government promised so much: a
      solution to our housing problems, open and transparent government,
      and a New Zealand without compulsory vaccination or mandates.
      Within a short period of time Jacinda Ardern has become the most
      diabolical and heinous leader that ever held the role of Prime
      Minister in New Zealand. Jacinda Ardern's Labour Party, has
      removed the basic rights of citizens and left many citizens in
      hopeless and desperate situations. Jacinda Ardern has removed the
      right of New Zealanders to return home to their country leaving
      many New Zealanders stranded overseas. Jacinda Ardern has set fire
      to the New Zealand economy, with companies collapsing daily, and
      inflation skyrocketing to levels not seen in a generation. Jacinda
      Ardern has created a media slush fund that has lead to a reduction
      in critical journalism, as so many media companies are now reliant
      on her government funding to survive. Jacinda Ardern has attempted
      to divide our country by racial background and by vaccinated and
      unvaccinated. Jacinda Ardern has encouraged hatred, lies, and
      misinformation at the very heart of our government. Jacinda Ardern
      has refused to meet with those who protest against her extreme and
      dangerous policies, trying to paint them as feral, unclean,
      deranged and unworthy of her god-like presence.<br>
      <br>
      Jacinda Ardern is without doubt the most deluded and dangerous
      leader that New Zealand has ever seen, and her continued presence
      as Prime Minister will inevitably lead to the destruction of much
      of our democracy and freedoms.<br>
      <br>
      Over the coming months this Blog will attempt to hold Jacinda
      Ardern and her Labour Party to account telling the story of their
      merciless and unrelenting attempts to destroy New Zealand's
      democracy. We will draw from multiple sources trying to bring the
      news to you.<br>
